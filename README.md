VSWM - Very Simple Wireless Manager
==================================

As the name suggests it manages the wireless network in a very simplistic way.
This version have wifi WPA and WEP, with dhcp and static networks. To use it,
just place the vswm.cfg file at /etc/ and add there your existing networks. When
you call the script (without any argument) it will scan the available networks
and connect you to the first available network that appears on the cfg file.


DOWNLOAD
--------

VSWM can be found at GitHub
[https://github.com/dmelo/vswm](https://github.com/dmelo/vswm). A ZIP file can
be found on the link
[https://github.com/dmelo/vswm/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/dmelo/vswm/archive/master.zip). 
Replace `master` with the a version number (e.g.: 0.1) to get an specific
version.


INSTALL
-------

    cp vswm /usr/local/bin/
    cp vswm.cfg /etc/

Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your $PATH. Copy the following line into your
.bashrc file (or /etc/bashrc, or /etc/profile)

    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

Reload the `.bashrc`

    source ~/.bashrc

Finally, edit `/etc/vswm.cnf` to include information about your networks.


USAGE
-----

    sudo vswm [ESSID]

It will make the script read the /etc/vswm.cfg file and connect to an available 
network listed there, if any.

The optional argument ESSID can be used to determine which AP to connect to.
Specially useful when more than one known ESSID is in range.
